			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>This project presents a vision-based object detection and tracking system that employs a Tello drone for tracking and an iRobot as the target object. The system incorporates the YOLOv5 deep learning model, trained on a custom dataset of iRobot images, for accurate object detection in real-time. A combination of centroid tracking and PID control algorithms is used to manage the drone's movement. The drone autonomously maintains a safe distance from the iRobot while following it through various environments. The performance of the system is assessed using the custom dataset, which contains images of the iRobot in a diverse range of indoor and outdoor settings, under different lighting conditions and orientations. By integrating centroid tracking with the PID control mechanism, the system ensures smooth and precise tracking of the iRobot, enhancing its applicability to a wide array of real-world scenarios.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>In today's rapidly evolving world, the demand for advanced, intelligent systems capable of perceiving, analyzing, and interacting with their environment is constantly increasing. Vision-based object detection and tracking play a vital role in fulfilling this demand, offering numerous applications in robotics, surveillance, autonomous navigation, and more. With the advent of powerful deep learning techniques, object detection algorithms have experienced significant enhancements, opening new possibilities for creating innovative and efficient solutions to complex problems. </p>
      <p>In this project, we present a state-of-the-art vision-based object detection and tracking system that utilizes a Tello drone to track an iRobot as the target object. The system leverages the power of the YOLOv5 deep learning model, trained on a custom dataset of iRobot images, to achieve real-time object detection with high accuracy. To ensure smooth and precise tracking, the system integrates a combination of centroid tracking and PID control algorithms, thereby enabling the drone to autonomously maintain a safe distance from the iRobot while following it through various environments.</p>
